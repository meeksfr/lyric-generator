Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
 
They tryna bring me down, gotta stay focused
When I get sad, I get the Hennessy and pour up
Fuck dirty Sprite, I get the liquor and the cola
And fuck my ex bitch, she did me dirty, I got no trust
I was only young, but I learned that these hoes ain't shit
I gave you my all, and this the thanks I get?
I still can't believe all of the things I did
I still can't believe that you would leave like this
Traumatized from the shit I've seen in my life
Everything you see right now is the highlight
And no matter how hard I try
Memories still living deep in my mind
I've seen my best friends change colors like a tie-dye
But shout out to the ones that still with me, those are my guys
And fuck everybody else that's just talking from the sidelines
Seeing it and living it, bitch, there is a fine line
And R.I.P. my brother, never got to say bye-bye
It gets hard, I know, believe it
I hope you find the help you're seeking
I was down in Hell, believe me
Packed up my bags and told the Devil, "I'm leaving"

 
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
 
Okay, hold up, I can't fold up
Be so sick, you lose a soldier, wanna throw up
I kept seein' all your pictures every time I scroll up
Now when we see a nigga, get him, quick to let that pole bust
Cali cruisin' in that i  with the doors up
Now we winnin', 'member back then, they never chose us
Now them bitches doin' backbends, givin' throat up
And I keep collectin' backends 'cause they owed us
I was really tryna find a way up in them streets lost
Don't be in my feelings really, I just be in deep thoughts
And it been fuck the opposites, no, we don't do the peace talk
Foenem come through rockin' shit, and that's another beat caught

 
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

 
I get lost up in my feelings in this Wraith, so I just look at the stars
Like, "Goddamn, we done made it this far"
This shit a blessing, nigga
'Cause I remember we was broke, they weren't messin' with us
I had to make my own way, I manifested, nigga
I dropped two-fifty on a Urus, ain't no Tesla, nigga
And it's still fuck the opps, I just don't be addressin' niggas
The feds screamin' out indictments, they collectin' niggas, mmm
Left me heartless, but I'm glad that it's over
No more cryin' on my shoulder
Pour up the Hennessy 'cause I hate bein' sober, mmm
 
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

Weight on my shoulders, but it ain't a feather
I'm praying that days will get better
If you wanna leave, you can go, I ain't writing no letter
They start acting different when they see that you getting cheddar

 
Weight on my shoulders, but it ain't a feather
I'm praying that days will get better
I do not need you, if you wanna leave
You can go, I ain't writing no letter
I stay to myself 'cause they start acting different
When they see that you getting cheddar
They like, "Why you so distant?"
'Cause I'm on a mission, I can't take my foot off the pedal
You see I'm doing good, now you wanna be here
Don't claim me as part of your vessel
I don't cap in my rap like you niggas do
I'm really gettin this shit off the muscle
I don't really do beefin', I'm focused on music
I'm tryna get out of the gutter
If you think about dissin', then come get up with me
I'm letting you know I don't tussle
 
It's only been one year since I started rapping
I already feel like the greatest
Life is a gamble, but death is a promise
You still gotta watch how you play it
I'ma just call you broke
If you got time for hating
A young nigga ain't even famous
I'ma listen to mama
She always done told me
If you want it, you gotta take it
Don't fake like you proud of me
Why would you lie to me?
All that I want is your honesty
People talk, that ain't stopping me
I'm a young prodigy
Nobody working as hard as me
Plus I'm missing my niggas
I know they ain't living
But now I'm just missing a part of me
I'm just that type of nigga
When I show my loyalty
People think they be outsmarting me
Watch for them niggas around you
When they see you eating, they gon' get to hating
I still be praying to God to forgive for my sins
But I listen to Satan
I had dreams about the NBA
But I'm still turning out how I wanted to be
I be standing on ten, I'm never gon' fall
That's some shit that they wanted to see
I'm all about money, I'm never gon' flop
When a young nigga get to the top
These niggas be faking
They put on an image
And act like somebody they not
All I know is go get it
I'm focused on music
It's time to go run up a knot
I heard they want me gone
And they gon' put me out
'Cause they heard that a young nigga hot
 
Weight on my shoulders, but it ain't a feather
I'm praying that days will get better
I do not need you, if you wanna leave
You can go, I ain't writing no letter
I stay to myself 'cause they start acting different
When they see that you getting cheddar
They like, "Why you so distant?"
'Cause I'm on a mission, I can't take my foot off the pedal
You see I'm doing good, now you wanna be here
Don't claim me as part of your vessel
I don't cap in my rap like you niggas do
I'm really gettin this shit off the muscle
I don't really do beefin', I'm focused on music
I'm tryna get out of the gutter
If you think about dissin', then come get up with me
I'm letting you know I don't tussle

 
I gotta go get it
Young nigga, I'm on a mission
I'm tryna run up some millions
I feel like I'm different
I think I'm meant for the riches
Tryna get out of the trenches
I ain't got nothing to lose
I feel like I'm Baby
'Cause now I got something to prove
Remember when bitches would play me
Now they call me baby
They love how a young nigga do it
 
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Weight on my shoulders, but it ain't a feather
I'm praying that days will get better  
Aye  

 
You know that I'm on ya
Baby I got caught up in the moment
You know I be trappin' 'till the morning
Tell me how you want it
When it come to you I just be phony
Sometimes I be feeling like I own you
Tell me what's the reason
Why you say you love me, you don't mean it
Put my heart on ice like I'm anemic
Damn I can't believe it
Tell me how the fuck did you deceive me
You can keep the fake love, I don't need it
 
I don't need a reason
All she wanna do is come and see me
You know I be working on the weekend
All my nigga eatin'
You know that's the way I like to keep it
Call these niggas clones they wanna be me
And I don't do no bluffin'
I don't do no frontin'
Runnin' out of time girl you better tell me somethin'
Money on my mind there's too many that I'm trusting
And my new bitch a dime but I still ain't finna cuff it
And she always think I'm cheatin'
Then we go to beefin'
Then I be like "fuck it I don't need you bitch, I'm leaving."
I just fucked a bitch and then I passed her like completion
Nigga play with me and I won't stop until we even
Tried to make you mine but you was busy keeping secrets
Now every time I see you out in public we ain't speakin'
Told you that I want you but you acting like I need it
Told that hoe to play like Michael Jacks and then beat it
Because I don't got no feelings
She's tell me that I'm distant
I know I said “I love you”, I wish I never sent it
I feel like I can't trust you, so I've been moving different
I've been chasing dollar after dollar i'm relentless
I feel like a genie in a bottle granting wishes
Cause any time you need me, you know that I come sprintin'
Cause your last nigga played I can show you different
But baby I can give you all my time and attention
'Cause
 
You know that I'm on ya
Baby I got caught up in the moment
You know I be trappin' 'till the morning
Tell me how you want it
When it come to you I just be phony
Sometimes I be feeling like I own you
Tell me what's the reason
Why you say you love me, you don't mean it
Put my heart on ice like I'm anemic
Damn I can't believe it
Tell me how the fuck did you deceive me
You can keep the fake love, I don't need it  
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like 
Na-na-na-na, every day  
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay  

 
I got some funny feelings in my head and, girl, I don't know what to call it  
Too iffy and quick, I can't say that it's love, but I know that I want some more of it  
These feelings been stuck in my head, ain't too big on love, but with you, I'm all for it  
See the world, me and you, we can tour it
Like, fuck all them bitches, ain't shit to ignore it  
Daily, you be on my mind, my heart hurt, beat, and bruised from the owner before it  
Got a good feeling this time, I been focused on you and I cannot ignore it  
Better than all of them combined
See, nothin' bеtter than callin' you mine  
You a ten out of tеn, you a dime
Fuck all the others, leave that shit behind
 
Girl, you ever loved a gangster?  
Got a feelin' that you never did  
It's a different type of love, different type of hug
Tryna catch it from a kid  
Yeah, I been through mad stuff
And my background and past rough  
Takin' shots, got my glass up
My life started a disaster  
Lately, feelings just been faster
Trench Kid preachin' like a pastor
You been on my mind, shit been out of line
Normally, I be on Casper
Normally, I keep it smooth
Guard up high like I'm a master
But it's somethin' 'bout you
I can't see through

 
I got some funny feelings in my head and, girl, I don't know what to call it  
Too iffy and quick, I can't say that it's love, but I know that I want some more of it  
These feelings been stuck in my head, ain't too big on love, but with you, I'm all for it  
See the world, me and you, we can tour it
Like, fuck all them bitches, ain't shit to ignore it  
Daily, you be on my mind, my heart hurt, beat, and bruised from the owner before it  
Got a good feeling this time, I been focused on you and I cannot ignore it

See, nothin' better than callin' you mine  
You a ten out of ten, you a dime
Fuck all the others, leave that shit behind
 
Sidestep, that's my flex
And you gon' die if you keep tryna play games
All I know is treacherous, fuck around, it's straight flames
Hate pain, but it's all through my veins
Rollin' dope, it go straight to my mind
How you be feelin', I'm one of a kind
Can't no one hold me back, how they gon' hold me back?
Destined to win, ain't no blockin' my shine
Took me a minute, I waited
Every year, shit get greater, I'm stuck in my prime
Soon get better, it's way more than fine
I be the type to just say less and grind

 
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like 
Na-na-na-na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

My momma seen all that money wasted, she was too sad  
Can't believe everything, that these niggas tell
Man they just be selling dreams, fuck your dreams and fuck a cell
I'll take a pill right now, by myself, just to cope with this

Used to take one, now I take two
Drugs they gon' help you through the breakthrough

They might never understand but they are not you
Mom said slow down on that lean, so I got to
You the only thing I got, you know I got you
Taking drugs tryna cope with the pain
He motions for the birds but they won't fly away
I'm taking drugs tryna cope with the pain
I can't feel it when I'm high, when I'm sober still the same
Taking drugs tryna cope with the pain
I can't feel it when I'm high, when I'm sober it's all the same
I'm taking drugs tryna cope with the pain

Final disclosure
I hope that you know it's over
I'm not sure why I kept you around
Always at my door but you're leaving me out
I get it, I'm crazy, I get it, I've heard it before
You know how it started
You used to treat me like I was only an artist
But I kind of miss that
Yeah, I miss the respect
It's a corpse in your sheets, oh for when you get back
 
Don't look at me like that you know you love to turn it around
You leave me so empty when you leave me alone and you know it
But I've got a life to live, I promise that I didn't mean to let you down
I know that you know that I know who you are
But sometimes you come off just like a stalker

 
The look in your eyes
It helped me realize that I'm not
Worthy of love from you
I guess that you're too cool
But I can't seem to leave you alone
I keep on running back
I never said you had to leave me alone
You just wanna see me everyday

 
Don't look at me like that you know you love to turn it around
You leave me so empty when you leave me alone and you know it
But I've got a life to live, I promise that I didn't mean to let you down
I know that you know that I know who you are
But sometimes you come off just like a stalker
I can't seem to leave you alone 
Yeah

Make his heart stop on beat, call it rhythm
Tried running game on me but just a beginner

Go cold on a bitch like the middlе of the winter

Take these drugs and then I get to rambling on
Drip on my body, she love whenever I put on that Comme des Garçons
She just want me to to go home
She just want me home alone
Chasing nobody, she won't tell nobody if I'm the one making her moan

The gas is exotic but I get good prices, she wanna pull up for the lows
Pull up to shop with me

Niggas running off with sauce and then blocking me
 
Pull up on your bitch in a Phantom
Fucking your bitch in a Phantom

She told me trust issues her anthem

 
I can't drop the ball, no fumbling
Take so many trips, I think that I'm stumbling

Anywhere she wanna come with me

Always walk inside a room with a gun on me

X  Lyrics 
Why I feel like Batman in this X ?  

 
Why I feel like Batman in this X ?
Soundcloud nigga crashing iTunes
Don't know what it is, I ain't that dude
Don't know who we is, we ain't that cool
I'ma make 'em feel it since they late to me
Lucki had that Percocet bean
Can't remember faces, but I'm gon' remember that dream
All these A&R's pitching out pyramid schemes
Throw your hands up
Show me what you want from me
In the fast lane, feel like I'm in Bumblebee
She gon' be a ho
Throwing it ain't nothing to me
Sayin' no to drugs knowing they'll come to me
 
She like the attention
No, I don't think she done with me
She like the attention
No, I don't think she done with me
She like the attention
No, I don't think she done with me
She like the attention
No, I don't think she done with me
She like the attention
No, I don't think she done with me
She like the attention
No, I don't think she done with me

Mmm, Melvoni

 
What you know about slums?
Where I'm from, you owe the hood
And you payin' back with blood
'Cause there ain't no actin' up
When them niggas after ya
You talk tough, better back it up
Pussy bitch'll get backed down  
And I ain't come to wrestle, 'cause this ain't no smackdown
All he see is a blackout, can't get back now
Got my gun in the background  
 
I'm in the booth with the stick on me now
I'm in your girl room, she like, "Dicka me down"
I'm like, "What about your man?" And she think he a clown
He gon' get clapped 'cause he thinkin' he down
He makin' that noise 'cause he thinkin' he loud
'Til my niggas come and we quiet him down

 
I only got one in the chrome
So ain't no missin', I aim one at his dome  
I'm with the thugs and shit
I'm with the dubs and shit
I'm with some A's in this
I roll with them Bloods and Crips
You knew what it was, lil' bitch
I ain't with the internet thuggin' shit
Like, where is you?  
It only take two shots to clear the room  
I feel like I'm  Pac before the tune  
And I could get you shot and smell all the fumes
And I'm lookin' for headshots, not no leg shots
With a sniper, but ain't no zoom  
I'm wearin' black in the back of the party
Pour up the Henny, I don't do Bacardi
And I got the glizzy, so don't be retarded
Load up the semi and aim for your target
 
I am a top shotta, the Don Dada  
And my niggas ready for war
You know that I split māthās, smoke opp grabba
They say, "Mel, ya gone too far"
They know I'm the top shotta, the Don Dada
And my niggas ready for war
They know that I split māthās, smoke opp grabba
They like, "Mel, ya gone too far"

 
I don't give a fuck what you sayin'
'Cause I ain't playin' with no pussy ass, lil' boy
I'm with the thugs and shit  
I'm with the dubs and shit
I'm with some A's in this
I roll with them Bloods and Crips
I'm with some thugs and shit  
I'm with the dubs and shit  
I got some A's in this
I roll with them Bloods and Crips

And they say that the apple don't fall far from the tree

 
Baby, are you tired of me? Are you tired?
Baby, why you lie to me? Huh, why you lie?
Got a chop on my side
Know you wanna ride with me
Huh, why you always tired of me?
 
Callin' my phone, baby girl, please don't blow mine
World War Two with the tool, it's gon' blow minds
I know that it's been difficult for you, uh
I know that it's been difficult for you
Big ol' bag, oh, yeah
Feel like a prince when I sip Belaire
This my blunt, nigga, we can't share
I'm sorry, I said, "Farewell"
LA, where I dwell
By myself, I'm stuck in my shell
My pockets, they swell, yeah, hmph

 
I don't know what's taking you so long
And they say that thе apple don't fall far from the tree

 
Baby, are you tirеd of me? Are you tired?

Shit, I'm born again
Free like the wind, hah, taheh

 
Zone   'Pac, with the squad, '  ROC
And we don't see blocks, where we not gon' see cops
Call a police opp   'cause police opps
If he turn on lights, gotta eat the blunt fo' we stop
Nigga don't want no problems, we gon' mop him
Gon' mob on that bitch on sight, just like a blog, don't involve us
Don't want them hands
My nigga Greg had them hands so they killed him, fuck
Finna jugg a Lyft
Since I just ran out of fucks to give
He pulling in now I'm mushing in, with all my friends
We ain't never had shit so we all gon' tag in
Once again, shit
Gotta put my folks on once I'm in, fuck you meant?
Once again, but if I wanna win
I gotta split...
 
But the   beggin' me to stay
Melodies helping me escape
If I leave, if I leap away
Promise things will always be the same

 
Yeah, big dog, ain't worked a job in a minute
I been jogging and living up in Cobb with my niggas
Ain't got no time to be involved in some shit
That don't evolve me, so really you can call if you miss me
And the Southside, still my home but I'm really
In the zone, you can still hit my phone if you near me
You can stop by, but not too long cause I'm busy
Writing songs 'til I'm dizzy, eyes closed, seeing visions
'Til it's real, once again
I swear I seen this shit before but now I see it
Once again
This time it's real, this time it's real
Once again, once ag– 
 

 
Set it up, girl, she don't like that drama, so it's stuck there

You took and L, boy, you went out sad
Shoutout my family, yeah, shoutout my dad

Even though all these niggas got me in they mouth
And these niggas wanna be me, they steal my sound
One of the hardest coming out my fucking town
I know that you mad, boy, I can see it on your face
Coast to coast, take a flight, boy, I'm in every state, yeah
And when I get my money up, I'm finna cop that Wraith, yeah
Me and Skai, we on the highway, we just might go race, yeah
Stole my heart and ran away, I don't know what to do

If I make all this money I be the same
And I promise I put it on everything
 
Yo let me talk bout it
Putting your love in somebody to find she a hoe
Yo let me talk bout it
I'm out here just pushing my music instead of the dope
Know that my parents want better days
See my own people change all like renegades

Should've known better than fuckin' with skeezer

Bad bad
Too many niggas in my backpack uh
Got a toolie and a glizzy and it matte black uh
Got these bitches shakin' ass up in my snapchat uh
This rollie on my wrist is presidential
If you ever broke my heart I'm resentful
Yeah I know that I'm a beast but its mental
If you ever hold me back then I ain't waiting for you
I got shooters at your place and they be waiting for you
In the club I go ape shit
Bad bitches on my wait list
Skee skee skee on their faces
Need a milli on my statements
Nothing good to say then don't say shit
Know a lot people who gon' hate this
Smoking on this loud with a *inaudible* yah
 
I want my diamonds on everything
They dancing on beat on my Patek Philipe
None of these hoes I can entertain
Rip my heart off my sleeve then I fuck em and leave
I got too many problems to feel the pain
I got too many brothers at heavens gates
If I make all this money I be the same
And I promise I put it on everything

I want my diamonds on everything
They dancing on beat on my Patek Philipe
None of these hoes I can entertain
Rip my heart off my sleeve then I fuck em and leave
I got too many problems to feel the pain
I got too many brothers at heavens gates
If I make all this money I be the same
And I promise I put it on everything

 
If you not sitting at my table
Doesn't mean I don't wanna see you eat nigga
Loyalty or love, who to really trust, hm guess its just me nigga
Had to move twice for a new life
Really was hard as a new guy
Had to make a new song say I'm too nice
Who really know you  
*inaudible* detach from the feedback
Only fuck a hoe twice if I have a relapse
If you got a little light then you got a little shade
Wanna see my people strive, than to put them in the grave
*inaudible* jeans it's Balmain
Try to give a girl my heart but they all the same
Stand my ground like Charlemagne
Poncho, new J's and a stoney ring
 
I want my diamonds on everything
They dancing on beat on my Patek Philipe
None of these hoes I can entertain
Rip my heart off my sleeve then I fuck em and leave
I got too many problems to feel the pain
I got too many brothers at heavens gates
If I make all this money I be the same
And I promise I put it on everything

I want my diamonds on everything
They dancing on beat on my Patek Philipe
None of these hoes I can entertain
Rip my heart off my sleeve then I fuck em and leave
I got too many problems to feel the pain
I got too many brothers at heavens gates
If I make all this money I be the same
And I promise I put it on everything 
First it was love, now it's fuck me
Stay out the mix, this shit can get ugly
Mom, I'm a gangster, them niggas won't touch me
Faced a couple cases, but bitch, don't judge me
Slide with them poles every night, uh
Pistols blow every night
They sayin' it's petty, just let this shit go
Nah, when I see 'em, now it's on sight
They killin' mamas and they killin' babies
Get snaked by your brothers, this street shit is crazy
I'm poppin' these Percs and they makin' me lazy
Send threats  
 
How you just switch up?
Callin' my phone, but now I won't pick up
You movin' crazy, I'm loadin' my glick up
I slide to the street, pose for these shots
Flash, ain't no flick up
I know I won't perfect, I probably won't worth it
The end of the show, so we closin' the curtain
Know one thing for sure, I know two things for certain
You get mad and you move like a whole different person
That's 'ight, wait 'til I see you in person
I pull out this metal and cut up like surgeon
Realized since we split, you was my biggest burden
I guess it's perspectives, got two different versions
That's 'ight though
Know I ride with the pipe though
Send niggas my way, it's gon' turn into a light show
Gang post up on your block like a light pole

 
Uh, look
You know how I move, I got nothin' to prove
You want it, I buy it, you get what you choose
You stepped to the left and you breakin' the rules
When I touch down, I'ma smoke shit like Juuls
I'm payin' for maintenance and payin' for schools
You out buyin' clothes, I'm out buyin' tools
Four years ago, you got pregnant, my semen
You watchin' my social, I'm flexin' in Neiman's
You want me dead, I guess you got your reasons
Keep sendin' them threats and I'm sendin' my demons
I'm out cheatin', you blow up my shit like Koreans
You played mind games  , and now we gettin' even
Tell them lil' niggas just go 'bout they business
Went to school in the suburbs, was raised in the trenches
Sneak dissin' for clout, lil' hoe, stay out my mentions
Friends bangin' my line, now you got my attention
 
You said you was mine, you said you gon' ride
Last time that we spoke, you wished that I died
Do what you do, 'cause you know I'ma slide
I love you to death and we both know that
But when I see you, I'm gon' open fire
Do it myself, I'm not sendin' my guys
Take a step in my shoes, you knowin' the size
 

 
I'm a real killer, you look in my eyes
Been hurt all my life and plenty done died
One thing that you know is I never will hide
Bring heat to my face and these bullets like flies
Keep one in the head, that's word from the wise
La Socket shoot first and that's why I survive
I don't trust a soul, that's why I'm alive
You claimin' you hate me, that shit a disguise
When I get back, you gon' meet your demise
In love with your looks, attitude I despise
I'm fuckin' your friends, you not gettin' replies
I came from the bottom, you watchin' me rise
Say what you want, you know I'm with the foolery
This new car, I bought that with your jewelry
Over your wack ass, ain't nothin' you can do to me
Tell them boys when you see me, don't say nothin', just shoot at me
 
Look, how you just switch up?
Callin' my phone, but now I won't pick up
You movin' crazy, I'm loadin' my glick up
I slide to the street, pose for these shots
Flash, ain't no flick up
I know I won't perfect, I probably won't worth it
End of the show, so we closin' the curtain
Know one thing for sure, two things for certain
You mad and you move like a whole different person

Still with the gang though, one false move, them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say they look for me
I ain't sacrifice the shit I lost, it was took from me
Almost went insane, went insane, went insane
From all this pain, all this pain, all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me, they keep me laughin'
Sippin' on this codeine got me relaxin'

Hit him with this trey, he ain't finna get his lunch back
Nigga, we don't play, jackin' static, you don't want that
 
I don't wanna fight with you, I wanna make it right with you
I could probably change your life only if you'd like me to

Fuck love, I ain't tryna open up no more
You be tryna find love in a place that don't got none

Why is it so hard for me to brush away the past
When you treat a nigga bad and you give me all these problems?
I was gonna call you on your phone, but it be hard 'cause we ain't speakin' like we used to
I heard you got another nigga and you're not alone, but does he treat you like I used to?

Woah
Shawty, what you know?
I would fall in love with the cutest girl on the globe
Then she broke my heart, now my heart is forever frozen
Now a nigga ballin' like DeRozan

Now my pain is deeper than the ocean

Pull up in a coupe then I vanish

She know that I do this shit, she wan' get blown out  
But after that she got to go
I can't trust no ho
Told that lil' boy learn his lesson 'cause this world, it get cold
I had to learn that the hard way
But fuck all that, this white bitch gon' come to my place
And I heard who you been screwing
She texts my phone, asks me how I'm doin'
I said, "Suck my dick 'cause I'm doing great"  
Nowadays I need you out the way

She asks me, "Who's to blame?"

Yeah, yeah
No self control on my own, alone in niggas to loathe when the money go missing, yeah
In my wallet, in my rib cage, I love love enough for comfort, knowing money go with it
I told her whether you like it or not, this thing of ours tied in a knot, I can't hold it no more
I don't think these venules supposed to hold venom or
I don't think exposure to this cold is for a nigga, boy
I don't even know if all these probes is worth bigger toys
I be talking shit that it ain't English words fitting for
I be in the bottom of the barrel
In the studio was raised in, just consumed in my vocation
That or loopy in rotation, that or
In the oven shooting movies with some brothers
Youthful stupor 'cross our faces, ayy, man
No self control on my own, alone in niggas to loathe when the money go missing, yeah
In my wallet, in my rib cage, I love love enough for comfort, knowing money go
Knowing money go with it

Yeah, yeah, yeah  
 
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown  
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now  
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now  
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down  
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

 
Cartier glasses,  / , got a clear view
You a man, I don't fear you
Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to  
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with
SB strapped up in the field with it
 
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga  
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you  
I used to fuck with you  , now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga

Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you  
I used to fuck with you  , now I'm wishing that a bus hit you

 
My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
Listen, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga
My mama told me, "Wisen up, be a smart nigga"
So all my niggas on go like a kart, nigga
Smelly drive mean a bullet to your heart, nigga
I don't really wanna speak facts, see the chart, nigga
 
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

 
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas

Sun LyricsOoo Ooo, ahh
Ooo, ahh, ooo

You're moving out to the sun
I'll think of you when it rains all-day
We don't gotta go out no more
How bout you stay in these arms with me
Never been too into games
But you still playing along with me
Singing these songs with me
Stay in these arms with me
Till fall, wait
Found out we had until fall
Hate the feeling of my stomach dropping
I hate when I can't fix the problem
I'm, sick that I know all about you
I'm, sick that you know all my secrets
I'm, scared you'll forget all about me
I'm, scared I'll get trapped by them demons
I'm, floating all out in the open water
Shoulda' known you were the reason  
Tweakin, shit I'm tweakin  
You ain't gon go find a new me
Promise I'm one and   trillion  
Trademark on me my due diligence  
Anxiety keep my head spinning, but right now
I'm in love with this feeling, cuz really

I've been moving solo
So long alone, feels like logo
Know you gotta leave
But just don't go
I'm Feelin so, so-so
Like I lost the paddles to my rowboat
Know you need the change, but I'm so low cuz

You're moving out to the sun
I'll think of you when it rains all-day
We don't gotta go out no more
How bout you stay in these arms with me
Never been too into games
But you still playing along with me
Singing these songs with me
Open my heart you feel my pain
Uh never could deal with my pain
I Think of your face when I wake up
You glued to the front of my brain uh
We skip the fight and just makeup
We don't got no time to waste
Girl, You make me feel so beautiful
And I'm just so stuck in my ways
I'm always out tryna replace shit
Wear a mask cover my pain you
Told me to show my face though
Made me not scared of mistakes
We're, finally on the same page
Ah, shame that we have to part ways
I, must have known you in a past life cuz
This shit feels something like fate
Uh, wait said

I've been moving solo
So long alone, feels like logo
Know you gotta leave
But just don't go
I'm feelin so, so-so
Like I lost the paddles to my rowboat
Know you need the change, but I'm so low cuz

You're moving out to the sun
I'll think of you when it rains all-day
We don't gotta go out no more
How bout you stay in these arms with me
Never been too into games

And I don't wanna waste your time
Haha
Let's go

 
And I don't wanna waste your time
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime
Don't wanna go down my mind
I think about all the times, what we've been through
 
Even when there's a blue moon
Pretty lady, pretty lady
I'll see you on the twelfth of June
Pretty lady, pretty lady
Don't you cry, I'm comin' soon
I need to go back home
So I can rest my soul and heart alone
 

 
And I don't wanna waste your time  
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime  
Don't wanna go down my mind  
I think about all the times  , what we'vе been through
 
And I don't wanna waste your timе  
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime  
Don't wanna go down my mind  
I think about all the times  , what we've been through

 
I guess, it's just
I'm upset, tough luck
You're my baby, baby, baby
Things have been so crazy, crazy
A mess, with us
I wonder if it's all worth the things we've been through
You're my baby, baby, baby
I'll always be your lady, lady, lady
 
 
And I don't wanna waste your time
I thought about that shit last night, in the wintertime

Pretty lady, pretty lady
I'll see you on the twelfth of June
Pretty lady, pretty lady
Don't you cry, I'm comin' soon
I need to go back home
So I can rest my soul and heart alone  
Good to now be here
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
"I thought you was married to the single life", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
I should've said somethin'
You said the only thing wrong with money is you ain't have enough of it
You said you deserve better, and now so do I
Anyways, the best part of us was me
When you got with me, you were a genius
Now without me, you have to live life as an idiot
I don't write songs, I write life, I told you that
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit
 
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart, yeah  
 
Forgive me Lawsy

Put lean inside my sprite, feel like such a diva  
'Lil shorty gassed up, ok, that's when I'm leavin'  

 
It's that...
Hopelessness... 
  Lyrics 
Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry when you lost random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

 
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
 
Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandonеd
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry 'causе your trust random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

 
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide

 
My mama mad at me, I know I fucked up big
My girl mad at me, I know I fucked up big
What's love? I guess I'll never understand
Every time I say sorry, I do that shit again
Check, check, check, I made a promise
That I would never leave you stressed, I would be honest
I should have never sent that text, I will be honest
I'm sorry for the things I said, I will be honest
 
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide  
Uh, ah

I'm fuckin' these bitches, I'm fuckin' these bitches
I gave her some money to put in her savings

This nigga tried me and I left him hazy  
I fucked on this bitch, but she cannot date me

All my life

I done met different type of girls, yeah

Now's the time to show 'em what I learned

 
Before I die
Every day I'm dyin'  
Every day I'm dyin'

 
Uh, rockstar shit like I'm Jimi Hendrix
Popstar baby, like I'm Jimi Hendrix, yeah  
Light my cigarette up like an incense, yeah

And I know I'm dyin'  
This shit got me dyin'  
This shit got me dyin'
 
 
My mama always knew I was a star  
Sacrifices every day, yeah
She gave me the keys to her only car  
I took that bitch and I went far
I'm one of the greatest like an all-star
I can't fall
Gotta stand tall
Back against the wall
Fuck all of y'all

 
But on a bright fall morning, I'm with it
I stood a little while within it
Man, you have to know

Gee Hues, you did this one

Like fuck the opps he be red dotted put a nigga on the shirt, he get murked
Smoke that nigga up like on some percs
Like bitch you cheated, oh you thought my feelings hurt, they ain't
Huh, you taught me better so I'm 'bouta do the worst
 
I'm tryna be the greatest, but they didn't want no chasin'
These hoes don't mind these niggas rob you leave you on the pavement
I caught so many niggas out, I ain't even got a friend
? me run in your house, nothin' ever changed

 
All I do we got a problem, up the Glock and dot 'em
All these flashes out the gun, he don't know who shot 'em
I'm in the streets, on the neighborhood done dotta
He wanna fight then we can fight, I'm a problem solver
Ay, I'm a problem solver

 
Fuck what I be scared, I ain't dead, bitch I'm fed
Up the Glock it's filled with lead, leave him dead at his set
You don't got us but I got us, oh nigga I said what I said
Like I don't think they feel me, like who the fuck gon' kill me
Like who gon' slide up in that Jeep and get to fuckin' drillin'
My heart been cold for a while, so it's fuck a feelin'
Another homicide, an opp think we did the killin'
I'm doin' good but, they still treat me like the villain
Watch me doin' good and they lookin' bad huh
I'm with the bitch that you wish you always had
Bitch this a Demon, it's gon' take off with a track
Leave the cops in the past, why your ops in the past
Feel like it's all my fault, I'm havin' suicidal thoughts
Sorry momma that I stole from you, them struggles was my fault
Sorry that I robbed them niggas now they truck gotta drop
Sorry that I broke your heart, but you a thot that what I thought
 
All I do we got a problem, up the Glock and dot 'em
All these flashes out the gun, he don't know who shot 'em
I'm in the streets, on the neighborhood done dotta
He wanna fight then we can fight, I'm a problem solver
Ay, I'm a problem solver

 
You put me through this shit, okay
I'm in the sun you throwin' shade
We in the trenches with 'em K's
He made a diss song I ain't listen so I'm actin like okay
I ain't no kid no I ain't pressin' til' you say it to my face
Goin' down, you gon' take that shit to the grave
Huh, it best for all my opps to go and pray
These niggas clown, but got a lotta shit to say
Huh, Imma laugh it off cuz I ain't dead today
You can't love me if you leave, yeah
I shoulda known better, why did you lift up your sleeve
I don't want you to leave
You don't want me for me, you only want the things that you see

 
I'm tryna be the greatest, but they didn't want no chasin'
These hoes don't mind these niggas rob you leave you on the pavement
I caught so many niggas out, I ain't even got a friend
? me run in your house, nothin' ever changed
 
All I do we got a problem, up the Glock and dot 'em
All these flashes out the gun, he don't know who shot 'em
I'm in the streets, on the neighborhood done dotta
He wanna fight then we can fight, I'm a problem solver
Ay, I'm a problem solver

 
Ay, mmm, dotted
Mmm, dotted 
I remember the way the light fell on your shoulders that day
I remember the face you made when you got the call that stole your hope away
I type out too many messages
The million things I wish that I could fix
I wonder if this is as good as it gets
As good as it gets

 
If it was up to me
I wouldn't have to be
Counting the heartbeats in my chest
You want me to believe  
But destroying myself is what I do best
 
Get me out of my fucking head
Sometimes I wish I could take back what I said
I wonder if this is as good as it gets
As good as it gets

 
Maybe this is as good as it gets
Maybe this is as good as it gets
Maybe this is as good as it gets
Maybe this is as good as it gets

 
If it was up to me
I wouldn't have to be
Counting the heartbeats in my chest
You want me to believe  
But destroying myself is what I do best

 
Get me out of my fucking head
Sometimes I wish I could take back what I said
I wonder if this is as good as it gets
As good as it gets

 
I remember the way the light fell on your shoulders that day
I remember the face you made when you got the cold and saw you hop away 
She hit me up
Oh, oh
Freshco made this

 
Just hit me up on my cellphone  
I'll pick it up in the early morning
Ridin' fast in a Ford
Hold up, pull up in a DeLorean
Kill a bitch and my enemies
Wait, nigga, we ain't frenemies  
Niggas snakes, but I'm venomous  
Dangerous 'cause I'm marvelous  
Bitch feel that Beretta vibe
Snipe right through that nigga eye  
One clip, open up the door  
Door is open, no suicide
Wartime, throw it on the mic  
Murder shit, now they outta sight  
Coming out the door with the light  
Always win, never lose a fight
 
Catch me swervin' in that SUV
Humvee army, shit green
Darth Vader, choppa shoot beams
Goyard match some Margiela jeans
What you trippin' over, lil' bitch?  
It's okay, she belongs to the streets  
Money fat, pockets obese  
Fucked your bitch, fuck the police
Picasso and a pink masterpiece  
Had to move a different way  
Nigga, move, get the fuck out my way
Cut 'em up and give 'em boosie fades
Nigga with a blade drip, flings  
Green target, nigga, shoot, aim  
Yeah, the same shit you do ain't a game
Ain't no respawn, change of frame  
Bitch, why you tryna fuck me?  
Try to fuck me for my last name  
Fortune, fortune, fortune, and fame  
Knock you out of Earth into the space  
Bitch, what the fuck you want from me?  
Shooter hidin' on top of the trees  
Got a lot of tricks up my sleeves
Smokin' gas, nigga, I can't breathe  
Smokin' gas, nigga, I can't see  
Just open up my wings so I can fly
Real wings like a monarch  
Chopper Iron Man, Tony Stark
Vroom vroom, nigga, push the start
She give me brain, I think that bitch is smart
She give me brain 'til I fall apart
So cold, heart full of dark
 
Just hit me up on my cellphone
I'll pick it up in the early morning
Ridin' fast in a Ford
Hold up, pull up in a DeLorean
Kill a bitch and my enemies
Wait, nigga, we ain't frenemies
Niggas snakes, but I'm venomous
Dangerous 'cause I'm marvelous
Bitch feel that Beretta vibe
Snipe right through that nigga eye
One clip, open up the door
Door is open, no suicide
Wartime, throw it on the mic
Murder shit, now they outta sight
Coming out the door with the light
Always win, never lose a fight

 
Catch me swervin' in that SUV
Humvee army, shit green

Fucked your bitch, fuck the police
Picasso and a pink masterpiece  
Had to move a different way  
Nigga, move, get the fuck out my way
Cut 'em up and give 'em boosie fades
Nigga with a blade drip, flings  
Green target, nigga, shoot, aim

I know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em
Did all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga
I'm from that   block, I'm still the same nigga
They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em
Boy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members
I was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers
Chopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him
 
Addicted to this ecstasy, I like how it feel
It's like I been poppin' X ever since I tried a pill
Shit got me through some hard times, I lost my mind for real
Lot of shit happened way too fast, I ain't have time to heal
Ed was gon' make it on that court but he died in the field
I was still hangin' in the hood before I signed a deal
Posted on Hudson, jakes ridin' past, I had my nine concealed
Hot 'nem do no talking, they just spark shit when it's time to drill
Lil Stank so reckless, he ride fast when he behind the wheel
My shorties hot, keep bending blocks, they gon' slide with the steel
We lost some soldiers in that war so they been tryin' to kill
I be dolo with my ice on, I been tryin' to chill

 
I know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em
Did all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga
I'm from that   block, I'm still the same nigga
They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em
Boy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members
I was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers
Chopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him

 
Ain't no playin' both sides over here, please make your mind up and choose
Bitches cheerleadin' and then they sneak dissin', I think they sort of confused
Please stop runnin' your mouth, that's how brothers go missin' and niggas get put on the news
You goin' through it, you losin' it, huh? My shorties eager to tighten your screws
Them blickers go off like alarms, but you ain't wakin' up if you snooze
Niggas be clowns, puttin' on shows for the media, I don't be shit but amused
I won't forget 'bout that lil' shit you said, we gon' get you for frontin' your move
My shootas some hell-raisers, come through clappin' broad, they don't give a fuck 'bout the rules
I played the block, went on them drills by my lonely, I had the four-oh up in school
Fightin' anxiety so I kept spendin' my last on all of the drugs I abuse
Down on my ass, they ain't give a fuck about me, I felt like I ain't have nothin' to lose
Now I'm in my bag, just tryna run up these millis 'cause I ain't got nothin' to prove
 
I know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em
Did all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga
I'm from that   block, I'm still the same nigga
They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em
Boy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members
I was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers
Chopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him  
Yeah, get extreme for respect
I know what it mean to be the nigga getting left
I done already seen how niggas get behind the scent

 
Niggas by me get extreme for respect
I know what it mean to be the nigga getting left
I done already seen how niggas get when it's the scent or a whiff of a cent
Don't judge a scintilla, I be with the sinning shit myself
But my center real solid
Something behind this urge for getting rid of dollars
I done already heard how niggas feel about my partners
So it's awkward in person when I don't give their sought acknowledgement
Some shit I saw that I ain't told a single soul I'm walking with
Leather grain broken same soles that I'm stomping in
Little bro can't go hang low swangin' walkin' in
Call him king and big his frame up for the confidence
Cold world just embrace us for the marketing
Cold world just embrace us for the marketing
I be careful not to say words I been charring in
I become a real A-hole in a argument
And that's the truth on me
Loose toothed youths, they couldn't give a hoot became my troops, it ain't no new homies at all
Behind my calmness is this new OG, I'm on
My mama finna need a U-Haul fleet, on God
You better chase me down if you owe me
Niggas even gave you two whole weeks
Women tryna get in loopholes like it's two sodas pour nuvo sweet thinking, the stu so
Appreciate it I'm cool though
Was one hell of a shoot too
I'm a loving ass nigga
Internet persona governing y'all brain like Bluetooth
Ay, went and picked out a new suit
Ain't get the job because my language was too crude
Ain't finna stop until brain outta loose screws
Ain't finna stop till I taste good couscous
I aim for the top
Vapors said I'd do it man I can't fucking not
Surgery tryna just get my veins out a knot  

 
Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah

 
They tryna take me for that ride
You in this game, it's do or die
Been havin' dreams 'bout suicide
Can't spread my wings, won't let me fly
And I done seen my mama cry
Ayy, too many times
I was young, I was blind
Couldn't read between the lines
Now a nigga worldwide
And I know my fans gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me  
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me  
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
 
Ayy, yeah, paranoid, clutchin', reachin' for that blick blick
Shawty when you suck this dick, I don't want no lip, ho, you see this drip  
Blue hundreds on me, but you know I don't Crip
Pop me a Perc' and I'm take me a lift
I jump in that pussy, it's just like a rift
Soar in the sky, gliders drift  
Yeah, yeah
Smoke a nigga like a cig', yeah, yeah
Skinny nigga, but I'm big, yeah, yeah
Hit the block, get it in, yeah, yeah
Fuck a hater, get revenge, yeah, yeah
Hit his ho, pull her wig, yeah, yeah
Ayy, I feel like Grim Reaper, grave dig, yeah, yeah
Fuck with solid niggas, no, my niggas never tell
Free Trap Trill, they done gave my brother hell

 
You in this game, it's do or die
Been havin' dreams 'bout suicide
Can't spread my wings, won't let me fly
And I done seen my mama cry
Ayy, too many times
I was young, I was blind
Couldn't read between the lines
Now a nigga worldwide
And I know my fans gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me  
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me
They gon' die for me, they gon' die for me...
 

 
Bugz on the beat

 
I hope these habits don't turn to suicide
Heart full of pain, I gotta utilize
You with the gang, it ain't no switchin' sides, yeah
'Cause I done seen this shit too many times, too many times
Too many times

 
Ayy, gang talk, this that gang talk
Pop these pills, they real prescription, just to take the pain off
 . 's hit like missiles, it'll blow your brain off
Put that lil' boy in the blender, wipe a nigga stain off
I'll die for all my niggas, I could never change up
Kill a killer, ride with pistols, that's just how we came up
Elliot diamonds look like Skittles, I just got my chain bust
Screamin' fuck all y'all niggas, y'all ain't show no love to us
Ridin' with that Glock box, aimin' for his tip-top
Fuckin' on his lil' thot, she gon' make that pussy pop
Speed it up then make it stop, bust a nut all on her crotch
Left him lookin' like some Crocs, murked him and they took his watch
Sippin' on some dirty Wock', I just popped a thirty rock
They know I don't Milly Rock, young nigga just gon' get the guap
You say you gettin' money, but who is you kiddin'?
Huh, wake up, my palms, they itchin'
She want Chanel, I'm going to get it, huh
Fuck all these hoes and I live it
 
I hope these habits don't turn to suicide
Heart full of pain, I gotta utilize
You with the gang, it ain't no switchin' sides, yeah
'Cause I done seen this shit too many times, too many times
Too many times 
You know I'm almost out of lean
I'm out of drank

Hundred thousand on my wrist, huh, lil' bitch, huh, yeah

Hit a lick, can't miss, ayy, yeah, huh, yeah
Diamonds dancin' on my fist, huh, ayy, woah, yeah
I was broke but now I'm rich
 
Blue hundreds on me, I don't even Crip
Told that bitch I don't even Crip, I don't wanna take no pics
Ask me how it feels to be rich
She ask me how it feels to be rich
I told her eat this dick
And I can see the pain in your eyes
You can keep it real, don't hide
Young nigga came and changed your whole life
We on five or six drugs, so high
Red lights, we ain't stopping at no red lights
Ayy, dogging hoes all I know, I don't think twice
VVS on my wrist hit so bright
I don't drink clean, dirty dance spike on the Sprite
Yeah, throwing up, bitch we going dumb, yeah, yeah
If I fall asleep, wake me up with that bed head
All these bitches digging my persona
He in that water, we gon' eat him, we piranhas
This ho a jake, don't call me a jake
'Cause I pop these pills
I'm a rockstar, I do it for the thrill, nah, for real
I got cake, takin' care my bitches, let me pay your bills
If you fuck a nigga good, I just might put you on my will

 
Hundred thousand on my wrist, huh, lil' bitch, huh, yeah
Codeine in my piss, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hit a lick, can't miss, hmm, ayy, yeah, huh, yeah
Diamonds dancin' on my fist, huh, ayy, woah, yeah
I was broke but now I'm rich
Daytrip took it to ten   

 
Now can we fall in love
While Southernplayalistic banging through the night?
 
And I ain't ever felt no type of way
About this living, do or die
 
And when they see our age
They say we're young, I'll let you push me to the side
 
At least we fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide
 
 
How you feeling, baby?
How you feeling, baby?

 
I travel, for you
I battle, for you
'Cause I love, to call, your name
I travel, for you

 
Now can we fall in love
While Southernplayalistic banging through the night?
And I ain't ever felt no type of way
About this living do or die
And when they see our age
They say we're young, I'll let you push me to the side
At least we fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide

 
Now can we fall in love
While Southernplayalistic banging through the night?
 
And I ain't ever felt no type of way
About this living, do or die
 
And when they see our age
They say we're young, I'll let you push me to the side
 
At least I fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide
   
Look me in my eyes, tell me you gon' ride
Tell me that your love and everything is not disguised
I been there before so I won't take a second ride
I keep a couple ghouls on my left and my right
You know I don't play that's why I got a third eye
Just in case a goofy ever try to end my life
I can't take no chances I can't see my mama cry
So everyday I'm figuring out a plan to better life

 
I don't know what's going on
I'm on probation so I gotta stay home
Big tooly on me boy you gotta move strong
I made it through the trenches had to make it out alone
Times get harder now
I can't let 'em just count me out
When they pockets running out
I'm the one they come calling now
I don't know what's going on
I'm on probation so I gotta stay home
Big tooly on me boy you gotta move strong
I made it through the trenches had to make it out alone
Times get harder now
I can't let 'em just count me out
When they pockets running out
I'm the one they come calling now
 
And everything I said before, it was really real
I could've died plenty times but I'm still here
I prayed for all my guys gotta keep 'em near
I hope my city survive, there's people getting killed
That's why I pray for all my cousins ridin' in that  
They want me to act up I'm tryna disappear
Everybody put your hands up if you can feel with me
I won't let a hater get near me

 
I don't know what's going on
I'm on probation so I gotta stay home
Big tooly on me boy you gotta move strong
I made it through the trenches had to make it out alone
Times get harder now
I can't let 'em just count me out
When they pockets running out
I'm the one they come calling now
I don't know what's going on
I'm on probation so I gotta stay home
Big tooly on me boy you gotta move strong

  by my side, it might leave where you stand
I ain't got no friends, I'm too focused on the bands
I ain't got no friends, I don't go outside
She ask me if I'm high, I say yah, yah, yah
  by my side, it might leave where you stand
I ain't got no friends, I'm too focused on the bands
I ain't got no friends, I don't go outside
She ask me if I'm high, I say yah, yah, yah

 
I ain't got no friends, I got brothers, I ain't leavin'
Focus on the cream, if it ain't cash, it ain't competing
I like nice cars, yeah I like my tires screeching
My shorty an angel, but she in love with a demon
I ain't got no heart, I think I lost it for no reason
Yeah I be the king and I ain't tryna deal with treason
She don't even love me, she just want me for my semen
Now she mad at me, I'm just like, "Shorty, why you tweakin'?"
 
  by my side, it might leave where you stand
I ain't got no friends, I'm too focused on the bands
I ain't got no friends, I don't go outside

I ain't got no friends, I don't go outside
She ask me if I'm high, I say yah, yah, yah

 
I call my lifeline
Double the cash, and split it with all my opps
I give 'em problems
If she'll be cool, I got no anger in my heart
I do not like the thots
They only want cash, I never pay for a thot
That's why I'm cookin' up
This music is crack, stand beside the pot
I got my heart locked
I don't give it out 'cause all of these thots is thots
I double up the cup
Freshman year, I was sad and sippin' and stuff
Double the bottoms up
Double the mud until I can't feel my face
Double the shorty's up
I don't want your body, girl, I just want the face
 
  by my side, it might leave where you stand
I ain't got no friends, I'm too focused on the bands
I ain't got no friends, I don't go outside
She ask me if I'm high, I say yah, yah, yah

Love,gas,bankrolls LyricsForever i'm hurt to the bone
Ima always be alone
 

I need love, i need gas, i need bankrolls
Call my plug, i need drugs, i need pesos
You a thug, what the fuck, you a fake hoe
Broken down, i'm so gone, i might faint though
I need love, i need gas, i need bankrolls
Call my plug, i need drugs, i need pesos
You a thug, what the fuck, you a fake hoe
Broken down, i'm so gone, i might faint though
Wish i could feel love, but i'm feeling numb
Ski mask like I'm Slump, I'm feeling done, done, done
Tryna make sure you're okay, but what about me cuz i'm not okay
She kill my heart with a blade, i swear I've been hurt in so many ways
I need to let out this rage, don't fuck with me cuz i'm spraying the kay
  every day, don't you come near me girl cuz i am not safe
I am on the path i paved, i don't have time to go on and just waste
I give my everything, it wasn't enough at the end of the day
Offered you my heart and my hands, you turned your back
The right state of mind, that is not where i'm at
I will be fucked up if i just put you right on blast
But i won't waste my time, you never loved me, that's a fact

I need love, i need gas, i need bankrolls
Call my plug, i need drugs, i need pesos
You a thug, what the fuck, you a fake hoe
Broken down, i'm so gone, i might faint though
I need love, i need gas, i need bankrolls
Call my plug, i need drugs, i need pesos
You a thug, what the fuck, you a fake hoe
Broken down, i'm so gone, i might faint though

Forever i'm hurt to the bone
Ima always be alone
   
I should've let you know that you're my only one
I know you're feelin' numb, I'll fuck you 'til you cum
Said, "I don't understand how you don't got a man"
You want me in your bed, 'cause I've been in your head

 
Baby, you've been up all night, so you don't wanna wait on me
I'm aboutta catch my flight, so you don't gotta wait on me
No more, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna
I've been up a very long time, wonder why they hate on me
I don't wanna love myself, I'm praying that they all love me
'Cause you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna
 
I should've let you know that you're my only one
I know you're feelin' numb, I'll fuck you 'til you cum
Said, "I don't understand how you don't got a man"
You want me in your bed, 'cause I've been in your head

 
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no  
Ayy, ayy

 
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo
 
Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold
I came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store
Big dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke
Do me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor
Nineteen with a bag, I got rich by myself
Rather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help
They keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt
Boy, I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt
Call my brother on the phone, he said, "Broski, you a star"
I said, "Brother, hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large"
And it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage
Now I'm in a good position for this life, can't sabotage

 
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

 
I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation
I could never get a job, so for my dream, I'm dedicated
For a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded
Now they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is
All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous
I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it
I was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient
Now I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation
I've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated
Five racks on this fit just to stunt while I'm in Vegas
Gnarcotic on my body, shout out to my nigga Caleb
Young niggas got the cake up, now these bitches wanna date us
 
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo  
I listened in
Yes I'm guilty of this, you should know this
I broke down and wrote you back before you had a chance to
Forget forgotten
I am moving past this, giving notice
I have to go
Yes I know the feeling, know you're leaving

 
Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, erring on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now
I'm coming around, I'm coming around
 
Nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

 
Spelled out your name
And list the reasons, faint of heart, don't call me back
I imagine you when I was distant, not insistent
I follow suit and laid out on my back
Imagine that
A million hours left to think of you and think of that

 
Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, airing on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now
I'm coming around, I'm coming around

 
Nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

 
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
 
Nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

 
Nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody
Nobody nobody nobody nobody
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
I took that ho to Belize, I took that ho to thе moon
Say that she rockin' with me, why she ain't chillin' with you
Say that she got a nigga, I guess I'm killin' your boo
Take that boy out the picture, yeah, I'm killin' him too
And I want it, I swear that I want it right now
And I'm calling, do you hear me calling right now?

 
I need it right now, I feel defeated right now
Just wanna see you right now, yeah
And I'm dying right now, feel like I'm flying right now
Don't let the fire die out, oh, oh
 
And I promise I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Don't get why I feel like, I been needing you
I patched up my heart and I gave it to you
Then you took my heart and you split it in two

 
Split it in two
So
So, I guess I'm done with you, done

Went from the slums to Neiman's, slide and fuck up his evenin'
Play with my heart, then lead on, want no lies, keep it
Don't wanna argue on the net, pop out, know how we seekin'
 
Used to take percs for the pain, now I sing melodies  
I went through all my life ducking all these felonies  
Bitch, I'm getting Arab money but I ain't no Yemenis

You only want me for the racks
She only want me for the movement
I run up my check, like let's do it
I know you girlfriend listen to my music
I got my check and I run right through it
They hit me up, they like how you do it
 
Show me your vision, she tryna convince me
Her love gets me pissed off, you better miss me with that shit
Show me your vision, she tryna convince me
Her love gets me pissed off, you better miss me with that shit

Don't do that shit that I hate, man
I know you're feelin' destroyed

 
Don't take that stress on this lonely road
If it holds you back you should let it go
When it's just too much and my heart can't talk shit
My brain switch clips like I don't give a fuck
 
I know you said that this your first and your last time
I know you said I really shouldn't take it personal
But how the fuck do you not take it personal?
When it was that way when we first met
Do things to bring me down, but it's still not enough
When it's you and me inside this room I see all your bluffs

 
Yeah, don't tеll me that was for my own sake
Don't tell mе this will make me stronger in the end
Don't tell me shit in the first place

 
Don't do that shit that I hate, man
I know you're feelin' destroyed  
Don't do that shit that I hate, man
I know you're feelin' destroyed  

 
Yeah, I did some things in the worst way
But you did it all in the first place  
You started war, I was hurtin'
Try not to get involved, you drive me in a hearse
And you bury me, bury me
Sometimes I see you care and think that you're scared for me
Sometimes you never know you're so unaware of me
Sometimes I think you care, but it's just too damn hard for you to say
 
Yeah, don't tell me that was for my own sake
Don't tell me this will make me stronger in the end
Don't tell me shit in the first place

 
Don't do that shit that I hate, man
I know you're feelin' destroyed  
Don't do that shit that I hate, man
I know you're feelin' destroyed, destroyed
